# My TBR

## Overview

A simple Flutter app to manage your "To Be Read" (TBR) list. It allows you to keep track of books you want to read, displaying them in a clean and organized manner.

## Features

*   **Book List:** View a list of your books, each with its title and author.
*   **Add Books:** A floating action button allows you to add new books to your list.
*   **Simple UI:** A clean and simple user interface, inspired by modern reading apps.

## Current Implementation

*   **`main.dart`:** The entry point of the application. It sets up the `MaterialApp` and the main theme.
*   **`book_model.dart`:** Defines the `Book` class with `title` and `author` properties.
*   **`book_list_screen.dart`:** A stateful widget that displays the list of books and includes the floating action button to add new books.
*   **`book_list_item.dart`:** A stateless widget that represents a single item in the book list.

## Plan

This is the first version of the application, and the basic features have been implemented.
